*"The journey begins with a baseâ€”where will it take you?"*

The code whispers softly, secrets to find,
2 2 the 6, keep that in mind.
Layer by layer, the truth will appear,
But look to the end, where clues draw near.

Do you see it? The '==', so sly,
Is it mere chance, or does it apply?
Decode with care, let patterns unfold,
A mystery awaits for the clever and bold.
